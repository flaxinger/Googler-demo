# Googler [Chrome Extension for Advanced Google Search Queries]

<h1>Why use Googler</h1>
<p>Googling is now part of our everyday lives, aiding us in research, jobs, hobbies etc. However, not everyone actively searches for better ways to form queries although google provides may powerful tools such as flags and regex. Although fully aware that there are advanced search tools provided by Google, not everyone makes use of them. Therefore this project aims to help more people easily use the powerful search tools provided by google; the final goal is to have as many people search better without the help of Googler.

<h2>What can I do with Googler</h2>
<ol>
<li>
  <h3>Use Flags With a simplified interface</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>site</b></li>
        <p>The <b>site</b> tool allows you to narrow your search to certain sites</p>
      <li><b>related</b></li>
        <p>The <b>related</b> tool narrows the search to similar sites to the given site. You can think of it as a slightly broader category than <b>site</b></p>
      <li><b>filetype</b></li>
      <p>The <b>file</b> tool narrows the results to a certain filetype</p>
    </ul>
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <h3>Use Regex with highlights to guide you</h3>
    <p>This is a rather advanced tool that is meant to guide people who know Regex but isn't very familiar with it. Google added a Regex feature recently and is expected to serve users with search results with better precision</p>
</li>
<li>
  <h3>Avoid certain pages in search results</h3>
    <p>In certain fields of study, there are certain sites that pop up frequently due to the search algorithm. However, removing these from your search results with search settings everytime may be tiresome. Googler provides a feature that allows you to avoid these sites on every search.</p>
